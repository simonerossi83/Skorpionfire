# My personal portfolio

This is my personal portfolio, made on all project capstones and challenges by **FreeCodeCamp**, **CodeCademy** classes.

This is my passion *(maybe discovered too late?)*, but I would like to make it my job!

## Technologies
This portfolio is based on:
- HTML 5
- CSS 3
- JavaScript ES6
- To prepare it I used also Git and some command line 

## Purpose
The purpose of this portfolio is to show what I have done so far

## Thanks
Thanks for your attention, I hope you enjoy navigating on my personal portfolio, as I enjoyed making it!

Simone
