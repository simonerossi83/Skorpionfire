# My personal portfolio
This is my personal portfolio. 
I know I am not a navigated web front end developer, I am still learning!

This is my passion *(maybe discovered too late?)*, but I would like to make it my job!

## Technologies
This portfolio is based on:
- HTML 5
- CSS 3
- JavaScript ES6
- To prepare it I used also Git and some command line 

## Purpose
The purpose of this portfolio is to show what I have done so far, like a sort of curriculum.

The main problem is that up to now I have worked using "easy" websites like [Wix](www.wix.com) and [WordPress.com](www.wordpress.com).
Now I want to start my own website, to overcome all the limitations.

## Thanks
Thanks for your attention, I hope you enjoy navigating on my personal portfolio!
